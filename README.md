# todo-list-native
Basically, this is the same todo list ase the previous repo, but it's made completely with native JS.

## Installation
Installation doesn't require any nodeJS-server, just open `index.js` in your browser.

## Filesystem
The filesystem is as simple as it's possible: `index.js`, `style.css` and `script.js`. That's all you need to know ;).
